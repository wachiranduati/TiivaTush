  <p align="center">
  This is a failed startup I worked on 2 years ago to commercialize Mtumba on an ecommerce platform.
    It was my intetion as the founder of tiiva to provide a platform, a platform that would ease the way we do our shopping as far as clothes are concerend.We intend to provide a platform, the first of its kind, where shoppers can interact with sellers from all over the country.<br> Dealing with open air markets we hope to get every single shopper on to our site, provide competitive pricing and free shipping and the best customer service.

### About the website

tiiva was born out of necessity. I was and still are a fan of cheap quality shoes but the problem was that most of my friends didn't really know how or where to find such. As a result i took them to my usual dens but being guys, were really not that good at picking out stuff we ended up leaving with nothing that day. Partly because the guys didnt want to feel less of themselves and mostly because they were lazy. This kind of shopping i was introduced to by my long time friend Miriam</a> and pretty much liked it.</p>But once i finished school and had to move back home, i had to find new shopping dens, but they never did reach up to what id had before, the fix wasnt enough. Merchandise here was more expensive and the sellers more hesitant to give a better price. More to this is the fare id have to spend commuting to make it for that saturday market day. This was too much hassle for a couple of shoes, plus too expensive bearing in mind that the 200Ksh id have to spend on transport would mean 1 pair less. Something had to be done, it was obvious that this was the case with other shoppers like myself. So i decided to build tiiva, ofcourse not that i was a new to code, i'd been writing code for 2 years and had quit not seeing its relevance. So the story tells where i learnt all about web development, all from youtube, stack overflow , github and most online forums. 7 months down the line and i'm glad to say that the struggle was a success and now i give you tiiva.
