                    <p>Simple. sign in to your account add item to cart and proceed to checkout. Follow the instructions.Here's the hidden info, you can add to cart when you sure about buying an item to temporarily prevent other users from buying the item and for 1 hour you literally own the item, after the hour is done the item is returned to the general mass and now you can only hold it once again for only 5 minutes after which your blacklisted from the item if you haven't bought it. The reason we do this is that items will normally surface as single units so like the open air market you have to compete for them. Be sure to checkout our blogs to learn on the new additions in cities and markets as we grow in reach. Adding an item to cart removes it from the site temporarily so in the occasion that you are looking through an item the page will refresh and redirect you to another commodity if the item is bought.Items on the site are updated every 5 seconds so lest be assured that if you miss out on one item you will definitely fall on a better deal later. You should also be aware that payment is via paybill and there are no transaction fees to this. so a commodity going for 50Ksh will literally cost you just that. Shipping is free.That deserves a yeeeeeiiii! on our side, don't you agree?Oh and be sure to check out the measurements placed on the item details to prevent yourself from buying a wrong size. Of importance to note is that we inspect the items before they get to you, and will ocassionaly call you about an order if we notice any issues with it, this is all to safeguard you the consumer. If the item does not match up to our standards we cancel order and credit your account saving the canceled order so that immediately a similar item is uploaded we save it for you in your cart for two days to look through it before its posted  and released to the rest of site.</p>
